# Churn-Prediction-Project
This project will guide you to learn build ML models using multiple Algorithms from Scratch.

# Why Churn Prediction ?
Customer Churn prediction means knowing which customers are likely to leave or unsubscribe from your service. For many companies, this is an important prediction. This is because acquiring new customers often costs more than retaining existing ones.

# Follow these lines and you will learn a lot.
At first I imported all the modules and dependencies.

Then I analysed data with various methods.

After that I tried to visualize the data condition to understand the market realities.

Then I tried with multiple algorithms and lastly I picked Gradient-Boosting-Classifier because in this case Gradient-Boosting is giving more accuracy.

I have achieved almost 80% accuracy.

# Final Advice
Please read the output and errors properly and you will learn from scratch and try to do google search so that you will be # UNBEATABLE.
